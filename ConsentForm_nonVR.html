            We are asking you to participate in a research study titled “Improving Understanding of Connecting 2D and 3D by Using Virtual Reality and Digital Prototyping”. We will describe this study to you and answer any of your questions.  This study is being led by Aditi Galada, Department of Fiber Science and Apparel Design. The Faculty Advisor for this study is Dr. Fatma Baytar, Department of Fiber Science and Apparel Design.

        <p>
            <b>What the study is about:</b><br>
            Apparel technical designers are a part of the workforce that gain expertise by improving their motor learning through practicing tasks related to moving back and forth between 2D and 3D models and prototypes. However, similar to the other industries, workforce’s resistance to using 3D digital simulations is a growing concern in the apparel industry. Therefore, urgent training solutions must be developed for accelerating 2D/3D digital transformation, while testing the ideas to design novel Virtual Reality (VR) tools to generate tacit learning by using simulations. In this study, a  novel VR  training approach will be used to educate future workforce about using desktop-based 3D digital simulations.
        </p>
        

            <b>What we will ask you to do:</b>
            <ol style="margin-top: 0px;">
            <li>First, we will ask you to fill a 10-minute pre-training survey before undergoing the training. The questions would be related to demographics, apparel spatial visualization skill and fit problem identification skill.</li>
            <li>2.	As a next step, you would be invited to undergo training on using 2D/3D digital prototyping software programs through non-immersive VR or conventional 2D videos. During the training you will view the content on a monitor, wear headphones, and navigate with the mouse and keyboard. The training would take approximately 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>After completing the training, you will be required to fill a 15-minute post-test questionnaire survey where you will have to answer questions measuring perceived learning effectiveness, motivation and cognitive benefits.</li>
            <li>Based on your learning from the training modules you will need to complete fit analysis performance evaluation tasks in a digital prototyping software. You will have to use your intuition to correct the fit of a garment by manipulating the 2D pattern. The tasks would take approximately 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>10-minute interviews will take place at the end of the meeting to understand the perceptions about the training modules. They will be recorded with voice recorders, and transcribed verbatim.</li>
            </ol>


        <p>
            <b>Risks and discomforts</b><br>
            There is no risks and discomforts expected during training. There are no expected long-term risks from participating in this study. If you experience any discomfort and wish to stop, you can quit the training at any time. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Benefits</b><br>
            There are no direct benefit from taking part in this study. You may learn more about digital prototyping software programs used in the fashion industry and undergo a unique learning experience. Additionally, the information we collect from this study will help us understand the impact of using VR on conceptual understanding and learning retention. With this knowledge, the workforce can be trained efficiently and effectively.
        </p>  
        
        <p>
            <b>Compensation for participation</b><br>
                    After completing the interview, in exchange for your time and effort, you will receive $20 cash as a token of appreciation for taking part in the study.</p>        
        
        <p>
            <b>Audio/Video Recording</b><br>
                    We will record your interview with the researcher using an audio recording device. We will transcribe the audio recordings as soon as possible after the interview, and then destroy the recording. Transcripts of your interview may be reproduced in part for use in presentations or written products that result from this study. Neither your name nor any other identifying information (such as your voice or picture) will be used in presentations or in written products resulting from the study. 
        </p>

            <b>Privacy/Confidentiality/Data Security</b><br>
                    Your name will be only collected on this consent form, and you will be given a code number. This number will be assigned to your data and further handling of data will be done referring to the code number only. The consent forms will be stored in a locked cabinet. Only the research team would have access to the identifying information. Research data will be stored on a password protected computer in a lab that is accessible only by an ID card. Your email will be only collected for sending you further instructions and surveys if you choose to participate in the main study. The emails will not be linked to the data. 
                    <br><br>
                    The data will be de-identified, meaning we will replace your identifying information with a code that does not directly identify you and store the data for future research. Any personal information that could identify you will be removed or changed before files are shared with other researchers or results are made public. De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community at large. By current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you from the information we share. 
                    <br><br>
                    We anticipate that your participation in this survey presents no greater risk than everyday use of the Internet. Please note that email communication is neither private nor secure. Though we are taking precautions to protect your privacy, you should be aware that information sent through e-mail could be read by a third party.
